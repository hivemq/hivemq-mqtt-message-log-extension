|===

== Installation

* Download the extension from the {hivemq-extension-download}[HiveMQ Marketplace^].
* Copy the content of the zip file to the `extensions` folder of your HiveMQ nodes.
* Modify the `mqttMessageLog.properties` file for your needs.

== Configuration

By default, all MQTT events are logged.
It is possible to opt out of specific log event types by adding a *mqttMessageLog.properties* files to your `<HIVEMQ_HOME>/hivemq-mqtt-message-log-extension` folder.
There is an example file available which removes the logging of publish messages.
Just rename it to *mqttMessageLog.properties*.

The events log only important information, if it is required that MQTT messages are logging all information available the `verbose` property can be set to true.
You can see the difference of a normal log versus a verbose log in the <<example, examples>>.

CAUTION: use verbose=true very carefully as it will flood your log immediately.

Missing entries default to true. *verbose* defaults to false.

== First Steps

Connect with an {hivemq-blog-tools}[MQTT client] of your choice.
You should see a log message with its client identifier, MQTT version, clean start flag and session expiry interval.
