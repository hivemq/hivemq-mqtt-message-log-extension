== Prerequisites

* HiveMQ Enterprise Edition (EE) 4.2.0 or later
* HiveMQ Community Edition (CE) 2020.1 or later

== Purpose

The HiveMQ MQTT Message Log Extension provides custom logging events on clients communicating with the broker.
This is useful for debugging and development purposes.

*The extension logs the following events:*

[cols="6,2,2"]
|===
|Event | Config Property | Minimum Version

|A client connects to HiveMQ | client-connect | 4.2 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client disconnects from HiveMQ | client-disconnect | 4.2 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client sends a PUBLISH message | publish-received | 4.2 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client sends a SUBSCRIBE message | subscribe-received |4.2 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ sends a PUBLISH message to a client | publish-send |4.2 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client sends an UNSUBSCRIBE message | unsubscribe-received | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client send a PING request | ping-request-received | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client completes a received QoS 1 PUBLISH with a PUBACK message | puback-received | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client acknowledges the reception of a QoS 2 PUBLISH with a PUBREC message | pubrec-received | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client completes a sent QoS 2 PUBLISH with a PUBREL message | pubrel-received | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|A client completes a received QoS 2 PUBLISH with a PUBCOMP message | pubcomp-received | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ sends a CONNACK message to a client | connack-send | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ disconnects a client with a DISCONNECT message | client-disconnect | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ sends a SUBACK message to a client | suback-send | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ sends an UNSUBACK message to a client | unsuback-send | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ sends a PING response to a client | ping-response-send | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ completes a received QoS 1 PUBLISH with a PUBACK message | puback-send | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ acknowledges the reception of a QoS 2 PUBLISH with a PUBREC message | pubrec-send | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ completes a sent QoS 2 PUBLISH with a PUBREL message | pubrel-send | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE
|HiveMQ completes a received QoS 2 PUBLISH with a PUBCOMP message | pubcomp-send | 4.3 EE or 2020.1 CE

== Installation

* Download the extension from the {hivemq-extension-download}[HiveMQ Marketplace^].
* Copy the content of the zip file to the `extensions` folder of your HiveMQ nodes.
* Configure the extension by adding a `config.xml` file in the extension's `conf` folder.
** For your convenience, we provide an example configuration `conf/examples/config.xml` that you can copy and modify as desired.
** The file must be located in `HIVEMQ_HOME/extensions/hivemq-mqtt-message-log-extension/conf/config.xml`.

NOTE: Starting with release 1.2.0 of the extension, the legacy configuration file `mqttMessageLog.properties` is deprecated.
Support for the legacy configuration will be removed in a future release.

== Configuration

=== Event Configuration

By default, all MQTT events are logged.
It is possible to opt out of specific log event types by adding a `config.xml` file to your `hivemq-mqtt-message-log-extension/conf` folder.
An example configuration file is available in `conf/examples/`, which removes the logging of PUBLISH messages.

=== General Configuration

|===
|Config Property | Description | Default

|verbose |Log detailed information about an MQTT event | false
|payload |Log the payload of a message  | true
|json |Log the MQTT events in JSON format | false
|===

Normally, events only log important information.
Set the `verbose` property to `true` to log all available information.
You can see the difference between normal logging and verbose logging in the <<example, Examples>> section.

CAUTION: use `verbose=true` very carefully as it will flood your log immediately.

Set the `payload` property to `false` if you want to suppress logging payloads (i.e. for publish-received, publish-send, and will messages).

Set the `json` property to `true` if you want to log the MQTT events in a JSON format.

== First Steps

Connect with an {hivemq-blog-tools}[MQTT client] of your choice.
You should see a log message with its client identifier, MQTT version, clean start flag and session expiry interval.
